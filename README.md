sky-remote-api
a REST interface for sending remote control commands to a Sky TV box.
It is basic and was ugly, but functional.
Usage
Just start the script, and then open a browser at http://localhost:3000/<ip address>/command
Ensure the text box at the top of the page contains the IP address of your Sky box.
Nothing more to it.
